Darwin is your swiss army knife for creating service based applications
in dart, using the inversion of control principle and
a powerful annotation based code-generator.

## Goals
- ðŸªŸ **Clear and readable!**
Almost zero boilerplate and services
make your code be more readable than ever before.
- ðŸ”‹ **Batteries included!**
Included are a variety of packages and integrations,
so you can fokus on creating.
- ðŸš„ **We are speed!**
Fast startups and no unnecessary code generation cycles make
darwin fast.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Make it your own!**
With many extension points, you can
customize darwin to your hearth's content.

## Silent Code Generation
A neat point about darwins **non-intrusive** code generation is, that it
has almost **zero boilerplate** and generally **doesn't require importing
or referencing generated source code**, except for just a few cases.
This allows you to keep on working on your code, without having to wait
for the build runner to create your required files for every new service
you create and plan to use. This also **minimizes conflicts** with other
external generators and helps to prevent unexpected build runner crashes.
