# Overview

## What is Darwin?

The Darwin Framework is a ecosystem consisting of many modules, which are designed to improve fast, modular and clean development of dart applications and packages using the [IoC-Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion\_of\_control).

## What does Darwin solve?

Darwin aims to solve following key problems:

* **Customizability and Exchangeability**\
  Inversion of control and dependency injection solve many problems a complex application might have. The abstraction of logic into services makes it easy to replace and visualize specific parts of an implementation.&#x20;
* **Agile Development**\
  Service based software development allows for better parallelization of work as development can be more easily distributed.
* **Code Readability**\
  Writing large or medium sized applications always has a great impact on code readability - or more exactly the lack of such. Isolation of functionality improves navigation and, together with powerful code generation of darwin, massively reduces boilerplate code while still maintaining a high level of readability.
* **Testability**\
  Darwin highly emphasizes the use of dependency injection through which both manual and automatic unit and integration testing becomes less cumbersome.
* **Dart everywhere!**
